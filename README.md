# Portfolio-U

Welcome to **Portfolio-U** — the only portfolio template you'll ever need. I'm not here to play around. If you're tired of cookie-cutter personal sites, bland resumes, and portfolios that don't stand out, you've landed in the right place. This repo is for people who want their work to speak LOUD and CLEAR.

## What’s Inside?

- **SCSS (43.5%)**: Custom styles, no nonsense. Modular, powerful, and easy to tweak for your vibe.
- **HTML (39.2%)**: Clean, semantic markup. No unnecessary tags or bloat.
- **CSS (14%)**: Extra sharp visuals. Forget the boring stuff, it’s all about impact.
- **JavaScript (3.1%)**: Sprinkles of interactivity, because static sites are for rookies.
- **PHP (0.2%)**: Just enough to flex dynamic muscles when you need it.

## Why Portfolio-U?

Because you’re not basic. You want a portfolio that’s as bold as your ambitions, and as unique as your skills. This template is loaded, lean, and ready to launch — whether you're showing off design work, dev projects, or your killer resume.

## Features

- **Responsive**: Looks awesome everywhere. Desktop, mobile, fridge display — bring it on.
- **Customizable**: SCSS means you change one variable, your whole vibe shifts.
- **Fast**: No sluggish frameworks, no slow load times. Blink and you’ll miss it.
- **Modern**: Flexbox, Grid, all the latest. If your browser can’t handle it, upgrade.
